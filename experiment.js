// First, initialize jsPsych using the `initJsPsych()` function.
// A few parameters can optionally be passed as arguments to this function
// that will globally affect how the experiment runs. One of these for example
// is adding a progress bar, which we've done below. We can also use the 
// `on_finish` parameter to display that CSV-style data object at the end
// of the experiment, which is useful for debugging. This page includes a list
// of other things you might want to do here:
// https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/reference/jspsych/#initjspsych

// logic will live. At the end of this script, we tell JsPsych to run 
// through the trials in `timeline` (in the same order they're pushed).
let timeline = [];

// If you're using any media (audio, images, video) , it's a good idea
// to load them in advance, which prevents the experiment from lagging
// while it's running. To do this, just generate an array with each 
// media path and supply that to the `jsPsychPreload` plugin:
// https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/plugins/preload/

// form. Included here is the standard department protocol. It's a good 
// idea to do this with the `jsPsychHtmlButtonResponse` plugin, where the

// Now we get to the actual experiment. For a recognition memory experiment,
// we want participants to hear a single token and make a keyboard response 
// in each trial. A good plugin for this is `jsPsychAudioKeyboardResponse`:
// https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/plugins/audio-keyboard-response/
// 
// As in the above trial, we can provide the valid responses in the `choices` 
// parameter. The 'stimulus' parameter is given the path to the audio file. 
// Many plugins also use the `prompt` parameter, which displays a string of
// html format on the participant's window. This can be used for example to 
// remind participants of which key is associated with which response.
// 
// At the end of the experiment, you'll get a csv-style output with all your 
// data. Importantly, the only things that will show up there are the default 
// data (trial type, time elapsed, trial index, etc.) and plugin-specific data 
// (RT, response, etc.). Any custom data you want to record has to be specified 
// in the `data` parameter, which takes another object as its argument. This is 
// useful for recording anything that is relevant to your experiment but isn't
// included in jsPsych out of the box (condition codes, correct responses, etc.)
// 
// Sometimes we also want jsPsych to behave dynamically, for example to provide
// feedback on responses in a practice round. Some parameters are often given 
// functions as arguments in order to facilitate this behavior, for example the
// `on_finish` parameter, which executes at the end of a trial. In this case, we 
// want to know how to categorize each response, so we use an anonymous function
// to call `evaluate_reponse` from the `util.js` file. That function just looks
// at the participant's key press, categorizes it, and then records it to the
// `data` object under the parameter name `result`. Even though neither is 
// defined within jsPsych, the output file will include columns both for `correct`
// and for `result` because we included them in the `data` object.
// https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/overview/dynamic-parameters/

// It's burdensome to manually define every single trial, 
// especially when most of the parameters are repeated. To get around this,
// you can use `timeline_variables` to define chunks of experiment logic and
// loop through that with e.g. a different auditory stimulus each time.
// Here's more info on that:
// https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/overview/timeline/#timeline-variables

// a question. Note that this plugin requires a special CSS file, which we
